In our quest to understand more of the AI (which is written in JS), we use the homegrown [JSDebugger tool][1]. And we contributed a little something for this ;)

<!-- more -->

The JSDebugger did not have keybindings for the different debugging actions like Step, Step-Into, Continue, Break, etc. And that's what we added. Though this was child's play, it certainly feels amazing to have actually contributed something. Oh, it does not stop there! Its committed in SVN revision #14014! :D
